# XSMILES visualizations in Jupyter Lab

A Custom Jupyter Lab Widget to visualize SMILES-based and atom-based scores.

If you use XSMILES, the use cases, its code, or the generated explanations, please cite our article:

**Article in preparation**, a preprint should appear mid September!

- [TBD Demo website](https://)

- [More examples with JupyterLab](https://github.com/Bayer-Group/xsmiles-use-cases)

- [TBD PiPY repository](http://)

## Example Notebook with a how-to

To use XSMILES with Jupyter Lab you need to install the package with pip **and have internet connection** while using it.

RDKit MinimalLib is downloaded by your browser.

Please check this notebook to see **how to use** the tool: [Notebook](examples/xsmiles_examples.ipynb)

Note that it is only being tested with **Jupyter Lab**. A reason for you to use Lab is the space available for visualizations, which is much better than in regular Jupyter notebooks. We also had problems with the installation with Jupyter notebooks.

## Installation

### Quick example - create conda environment and installs xsmiles

```bash
conda create --name xsmiles_env python=3.7 -c conda-forge # create conda env with python 3.7

conda activate xsmiles_env # activate the created env

conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab # install jupyter lab

pip install xsmiles # if xsmiles is not in pip yet, try pip install xsmiles-0.2.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl
# Download the most up to date whl from this repository's releases)

jupyter lab examples/xsmiles_examples.ipynb # run a notebook with jupyter lab
```

## Uninstall

- `pip uninstall xsmiles`
- `rm -r <path-to:>/share/jupyter/labextensions/xsmiles`
- `jupyter labextension list`


## Development

Please check the `DEVELOPMENT.md` file.
